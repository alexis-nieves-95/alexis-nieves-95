## A Bit About Me

My name is Alexis Nieves, and I am an undergraduate student at Western Governors University majoring in Computer Science.

I am on track to graduate within the upcoming year. I enjoy languages such as Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. I'm hoping to develop useful programs,
and dabble in website creation.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, listening to music, playing guitar, golfing, and chatting with friends.
